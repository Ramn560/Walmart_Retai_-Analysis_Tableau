This dataset contains the actual data for sales forecasting and analysis. By identifying variables that influence sales and creating time series models, we aim to forecast Walmart's future sales using available historical data. The study also explores whether sales are higher during holidays like Christmas and Thanksgiving compared to non-holiday days, allowing retailers to focus on developing special offers that drive sales and increase revenue. Understanding consumer purchasing patterns based on regional and departmental sales is another important aspect of this study.

Our project's main objective is to forecast sales and determine the factors that impact them. We will analyze purchasing patterns from the dataset and develop time series models to assist retailers in developing promotions that optimize sales based on demographics and the time of year. The dataset provides opportunities to address various questions, such as identifying products that meet key consumer needs, determining which store will have the highest sales, identifying stores with good quarterly growth rates, and estimating the sales increase during holiday seasons.
